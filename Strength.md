# Password strength #

That thing under the password is called the Strength meter and it shows you how secure is your password.
In short, long passwords with many selected charsets are more secure than short passwords with few charsets.
Mouse over it and you will see a tooltip with combinations number, password length in bits and maximum crack time for the currently selected password options.

Here`s how the program evaluates strength of generated passwords:

| **Password strength** | **Crack time, days** |
|:----------------------|:---------------------|
| ![http://awesome-password-generator.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pics/weak.png](http://awesome-password-generator.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pics/weak.png) | 0 – 7                |
| ![http://awesome-password-generator.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pics/normal.png](http://awesome-password-generator.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pics/normal.png) | 7 – 60               |
| ![http://awesome-password-generator.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pics/good.png](http://awesome-password-generator.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pics/good.png) | 60 – 365             |
| ![http://awesome-password-generator.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pics/excellent.png](http://awesome-password-generator.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/pics/excellent.png) | >365                 |

Crack speed: assuming 1.33 billion guesses per second (or passwords per second – pps). NVIDIA GeForce GTX 295 can try up to 1.33 billion Vista NTLM passwords per second, so it's just a speed of a single home PC.

Professional cracking speed can be 100 billion pps and higher, but:
  * Different algorithms have different crack speeds. E.g. RAR-archive crack speed on a single PC is about 1-2 thousands pps;
  * Remote cracking of online accounts (e-mail, social networks, online games) is also about 1000 pps;
  * Previously mentioned professional cracking is expensive; hacker will not waste such resources and time without a good reason.

Anyway, using passwords with EXCELLENT strength is recommended.
